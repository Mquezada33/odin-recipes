                    <p class="paragraph">This is one of the few occasions when overcrowding the skillet is a good thing. These carrots are cooked in fat (schmaltz, olive oil, butter), with a pinch of something spicy (red-pepper flakes, cayenne, even hot paprika), sort of half-steaming on top of each other until just tender (no mushy carrots here, please). At the end, they are seasoned with a bit of finely grated or chopped garlic off the heat, which quiets the garlicky punchiness without extinguishing it entirely. Like a sandwich cut into triangles, the fact that the carrots are sliced into rounds makes them taste above-average delicious.</p>
                        <h2 class="container">Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li>¼ cup chicken fat, olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
                        <li>¼ cup olive oil </li>
                        <li> Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional) </li>
                        <li>2 bunches carrots, topped removed (about 1 pound), thinly sliced into rounds</li>
                        <li> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li> 
                        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped or grated</li>   
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="container">Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Melt chicken fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat. (If using butter, melt until lightly foamy and starting to brown, 2 to 3 minutes.) Add olive oil and red-pepper flakes, if using, swirling to bloom a bit in the butter. Add carrots and season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until carrots are just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. (They should be simply softened, like al dente pasta, not soft or mushy.)</li>
                        <li>Remove pan from heat, and add garlic, tossing to coat, and transfer to serving bowl.</li>  
                        </ol>
